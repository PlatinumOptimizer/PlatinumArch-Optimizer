üîß Detailed Optimization Explanation
CPU Optimizations
Performance Governor: Sets CPU frequency scaling to "performance" mode for maximum clock speeds

Intel-specific: Enables intel_pstate driver and limits C-states for responsive performance

AMD-specific: Activates amd_pstate driver for modern AMD processors

Kernel Parameters: Disables watchdog timers, optimizes scheduler settings

Core-specific: Adjusts scheduler latency based on core count (better scaling for multi-core CPUs)

GPU Optimizations
NVIDIA:

Enables persistence mode (keeps GPU initialized when not in use)

Sets PowerMizer to maximum performance

Enables Coolbits for potential overclocking

Configures Xorg settings for optimal performance

AMD:

Forces maximum performance DPM state

Installs latest Mesa and Vulkan drivers

Intel:

Sets performance power management

Installs Intel-specific graphics drivers

Automatic driver installation for all detected GPU types

Memory Optimizations
Swappiness reduction (10): Reduces tendency to swap to disk

Cache pressure adjustment (50): Optimizes filesystem cache behavior

Dirty ratio tuning: Controls when writebacks occur to disk

Min_free_kbytes optimization: Reserves appropriate emergency memory

Early OOM: Prevents system freezes by proactively killing processes before complete memory exhaustion

Disk Optimizations
SSD-specific:

Enables TRIM support (fstrim.timer)

Increases readahead value (256KB)

Disables access time recording (noatime, nodiratime)

Uses BFQ I/O scheduler for better responsiveness

HDD-specific:

Uses mq-deadline scheduler for better throughput

Filesystem tuning: Optimizes writeback timing and cache behavior

Network Optimizations
TCP BBR congestion control: Modern algorithm for better throughput and lower latency

Buffer size increases: Larger network buffers for better performance

TCP Fast Open: Reduces connection establishment time

Gaming optimizations:

Increased connection backlogs

TCP keepalive adjustments

TW bucket increases for better connection handling

MTU probing: Automatic maximum transmission unit discovery

Kernel Optimizations
Kernel Zen installation: If not present, installs the Zen kernel with performance patches

I/O scheduler configuration: BFQ for SSDs, mq-deadline for HDDs

File descriptor limit increase (1000000): Allows more simultaneous open files

Scheduler tuning: Adjustments for better interactive performance

Watchdog disable: Reduces overhead from unnecessary monitoring

Security Tweaks
Balance between security and performance:

Disables some CPU mitigations for better performance (mitigations=off)

Adjusts kernel pointer restrictions

Reduces dmesg restrictions for better debugging

Note: These changes slightly reduce security for significant performance gains

Service Optimizations
cpupower.service: Enables CPU frequency management

fstrim.timer: Regular TRIM operations for SSDs

earlyoom.service: Early out-of-memory management

irqbalance.service: Distributes interrupts across CPUs

nvidia-persistenced: Keeps NVIDIA GPUs initialized

preload: Anticipates and preloads commonly used applications

‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
Backup your system before proceeding

The script modifies critical system parameters

Some optimizations disable security mitigations for performance

Reboot required to apply all changes

Primarily tested on Arch Linux - may require modifications for other distros

üîÑ Rollback
The script automatically backs up modified configuration files. To restore:

Restore original configuration files from backups

Reset services to default values

Reboot the system

üìä Benchmarking
After optimization, you can test improvements with:

bash
# CPU benchmark
sysbench cpu run

# Disk benchmark
hdparm -Tt /dev/sda

# Memory benchmark
sysbench memory run

# Network benchmark
iperf3 -c your-server

üîç Monitoring Performance
After applying optimizations, monitor your system with:

bash
# CPU frequency
cpupower frequency-info

# GPU status
nvidia-smi # or radeontop, intel_gpu_top

# Memory usage
free -h

# Disk I/O
iotop

# Network stats
ss -tulpn
